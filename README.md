# AVL-Tree-List:

This repository contains the implementation of a List using an AVL and Rank Tree data structures in Python. 

## About
Lists are a abstract data type (ADT) in computer science. The two classic ways to implement a list are the array and the linked list. 
While each one has its own advantages, each has some operations with the slow Θ(n) time complexity.

By using a self-balancing tree structure – such as an AVL tree, it is possible to implement a list that can access and modify single elements in just Θ(log n) worst-case time, where n is the current size of the list.
